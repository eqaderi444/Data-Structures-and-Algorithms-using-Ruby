# Data Structures and Algorithms implementation using Ruby
I created this repository to learn data structures and algorithms effectively and to make the learning process easy for new students. here, I share all the useful links for learning data structure and algorithms including attached code links that I have implemented in ruby language.

## Linked List

## Stack 
A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items happens on the same end. Usually, this end is referred to as the **top**, while the opposite end is referred to as the **base**. The closer an item is to the base, the longer it has been on the stack. The most recently added item will always be at the top. Hence, the ordering method used here is **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO).** A good example of a stack usage is a web browser back button. On navigation using the back button, the web pages will be displayed in order visited, starting with the most recently visited page. Below is a simple implementation of the stack data structure in Ruby.

## Queue
A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens on one end and the removal of existing items happens at the other end. Usually, the end where new items are added is called the **rear** and the end where existing items are removed is called the **front**. A new element added starts at the rear and moves subsequently to the front. The closer an element is to the rear, the longer it has to wait to be removed. Hence, the ordering method used here is **First-In-First-Out (FIFO).** A good example of queue usage is a printer. Print tasks sent to a printer are always queued in the order they were sent. The first print task sent will be printed the first, the second print task will be printed the second, in that order. Below is a simple implementation of the queue data structure in Ruby.
